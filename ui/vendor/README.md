# Vendored browser client

It is vendored rather than installed from a registry so the image carries one reviewed file instead of a package dependency. The client holds no keys: the session key lives in the Privasys ID iframe it opens, and the page exchanges plaintext with that iframe over `postMessage`.

To update: rebuild at a tagged SDK release, replace the file, and update this table.
